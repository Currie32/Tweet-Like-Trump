# Tweet-Like-Trump

A one2seq model that can generate tweets similar to those of Donald Trump. TensorFlow 1.0.1 is used to build the model. The data is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/better-donald-trump-tweets

I wrote an article that provides a rather detailed walkthrough of this project: https://medium.com/@Currie32/tweet-like-trump-with-a-one2seq-model-cb1461f9d54c

Some examples of tweets that are generated:
